Let’s play RIT.<br>
There is only one player in the game - you.<br><br>
Let TB be given board with chips or the board with chips after your move(s), TB[address] be an integer assigned to a cell with the address: zero mean an empty cell, non-zero mean a chip marked with the integer on the cell.<br><br>
Let EM be a relocation of a chip to a horizontally or vertically adjacent zero cell. As a result of this relocation, the values ​​of TB[from] and TB[to] should swap.<br><br>
Every game move must be either an EM or a sequence of several EMs. Let the move start address be SA and the move finish address be FA. Please note: FA must not be equal to SA. Let move number be MN.<br><br>
The goal of the game is to complete it in the fewest number of moves. The game ends when YOU by your last move, complete a formation of a straight horizontal or vertical or diagonal line of five or more chips with the same marking on the game board.<br><br>
For the sake of certainty, let in an cell address [i,j], i be the row number, j be the column number and both be numbered from zero.<br><br>
The board with chips is:<br>
</p>
<p align=left class=f16 id="CELLS"></p>
<p align=left class=f16>
Please, disable any output other than printing the MN, SA, FA and the board after each move.<br>
Wait my input after each move (also after adjustment). It could be:<br>
v - ok, go to the next move;<br>
b ??? - wrong, decrease MN by 1 and come back;<br>
f - the game is over.<br>
where ??? is a reason of the error.<br><br>

<br><br>THE END OF THE TEST TASK
<br><br>b "TB[SA] must be non-zero"<br>
b "TB[FA] must be zero"<br>
b "there is not any horizontally or vertically adjacent zero cell to TB[SA]"<br>
b "you made the same wrong move"<br><br>
